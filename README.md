This project is an AI-powered recipe finder web app built using React. The app allows users to describe what they want to eat in a brief sentence, and it will fetch a list of recipes based on the description using AI. Users can view detailed recipe information, including ingredients and instructions, and add recipes to their favorites list.
Features

    Recipe Search: Users can input a brief description of the dish they want to make (e.g., "chicken pasta" or "vegan salad"), and the app will fetch a list of relevant recipes using AI.
    Recipe Details: Users can view detailed information for each recipe, including ingredients and step-by-step cooking instructions.
    Favorites List: Users can save recipes to their favorites list for quick access later.
    Responsive Design: The app is designed to be fully responsive, working seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices. The layout and proportions will respect the provided design (Figma link below).
    AI Integration: The app integrates with an AI tool (such as OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, etc.) to generate recipe suggestions based on user input.
